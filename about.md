Gefyra is based on well-crafted open source software. Special credits go to the teams of 
[https://www.linuxserver.io/](linxuserver.io) and [https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/](Wireguard(-go)). Please
be sure to check out their awesome work.  
Gefyra was heavily inspired by the free part of Telepresence2.  

This open source project is currently mainly carried out by  
[Michael Schilonka](https://github.com/Schille)
and supported by the team of [unikube.io](https://unikube.io).

This project is sponsored by [Blueshoe GmbH](https://blueshoe.de).
